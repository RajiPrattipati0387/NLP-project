One area where AI is making significant strides is in natural language processing (NLP), allowing computers to understand and generate human language. NLP applications range from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to sentiment analysis in social media.\n","\n","Another emerging technology is blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger that securely records transactions across a network of computers. Blockchain is best known as the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but its potential extends far beyond digital currencies. It has applications in supply chain management, healthcare, and voting systems, among others.\n","\n","The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of interconnected devices embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies, enabling them to collect and exchange data. IoT devices can include everyday objects like smart thermostats, wearable fitness trackers, and industrial machinery. The data generated by IoT devices can be analyzed to improve efficiency, monitor performance, and enhance user experience.\n","\n","Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are immersive technologies that blend the physical and digital worlds. VR creates a fully immersive simulated environment, while AR overlays digital content onto the real world. These technologies have applications in gaming, education, healthcare, and training, offering new ways to interact with digital content and experiences.\n","\n","Cybersecurity is a critical concern in today's digital age, with cyberattacks becoming increasingly sophisticated and widespread. Organizations must employ robust security measures to protect their data, networks, and systems from unauthorized access, malware, and other cyber threats. This includes encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits.\n","\n","Quantum computing is an emerging field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations at speeds far beyond traditional computers. Unlike classical bits, which can only exist in one state (0 or 1), quantum bits (qubits) can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for parallel processing and exponential computational power. Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, optimization, and drug discovery.\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","results = generate_mcqs(text, num_questions=10)\n","\n","\n","for i, mcq in enumerate(results,start=1):\n","    question_stem, answer_choices, correct_answer = mcq\n","\n","    print(f\"Q{i}: {question_stem}\")\n","    print('_______------------------------')\n","    for j, choice  in enumerate(answer_choices, start=1):\n","        print(f\"{chr(64+j)}: {choice}\")\n","    print(f\"Correct Answer: {correct_answer}\")\n","    print(\"============================================================================\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"520CneLCeCpr","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1729136550973,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":476,"user":{"displayName":"Prattipati Raji","userId":"07301291107726036638"}},"outputId":"5d6f307f-b82a-488c-df1b-6fd8b1f9a048"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Q1: These _______ have applications in gaming, education, healthcare, and training, offering new ways to interact with digital content and experiences.\n","\n","\n","_______------------------------\n","A: applications\n","B: education\n","C: content\n","D: technologies\n","Correct Answer: D\n","============================================================================\n","Q2: Unlike classical _______, which can only exist in one state (0 or 1), quantum _______ (qu_______) can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for parallel processing and exponential computational power.\n","_______------------------------\n","A: processing\n","B: qubits\n","C: qubits\n","D: bits\n","Correct Answer: D\n","============================================================================\n","Q3: One area where AI is making significant strides is in natural _______ processing (NLP), allowing computers to understand and generate human _______.\n","_______------------------------\n","A: processing\n","B: language\n","C: strides\n","D: computers\n","Correct Answer: B\n","============================================================================\n","Q4: Another emerging _______ is blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger that securely records transactions across a network of computers.\n","_______------------------------\n","A: technology\n","B: ledger\n","C: network\n","D: ledger\n","Correct Answer: A\n","============================================================================\n","Q5: \n","Artificial _______ (AI) is revolutionizing various industries by enabling machines to perform tasks that typically require human _______.\n","_______------------------------\n","A: industries\n","B: tasks\n","C: industries\n","D: intelligence\n","Correct Answer: D\n","============================================================================\n","Q6: _______ is a critical concern in today's digital age, with cyberattacks becoming increasingly sophisticated and widespread.\n","_______------------------------\n","A: concern\n","B: concern\n","C: cyberattacks\n","D: Cybersecurity\n","Correct Answer: D\n","============================================================================\n","Q7: Quantum _______ is an emerging field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations at speeds far beyond traditional computers.\n","_______------------------------\n","A: speeds\n","B: field\n","C: computing\n","D: principles\n","Correct Answer: C\n","============================================================================\n","Q8: _______ applications range from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to sentiment analysis in social media.\n","\n","\n","_______------------------------\n","A: NLP\n","B: applications\n","C: range\n","D: range\n","Correct Answer: A\n","============================================================================\n","Q9: This includes _______, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits.\n","\n","\n","_______------------------------\n","A: detection\n","B: encryption\n","C: security\n","D: audits\n","Correct Answer: B\n","============================================================================\n","Q10: The _______ of Things (IoT) refers to the network of interconnected devices embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies, enabling them to collect and exchange data.\n","_______------------------------\n","A: technologies\n","B: devices\n","C: devices\n","D: Internet\n","Correct Answer: D\n","============================================================================\n"]}]}]}
